# Power-BI and Dashboard on "Data Professional Survey Breakdown" -

# AUTHOR = AKILESH S,

The codes and information listed above are unique and it is open source to use,

The files provided contain codes and visualization of different charts on **POWER BI**,

I started from scratch and advanced my skills in **Power BI** by practicing various operations, visualizations, and creating dashboards on **POWER BI**.

**Day - 1**: I installed Power BI, uploaded the dataset, introduced Query, explored the user interface, and built the first visualization.

**Day - 2**: I examined the data, loaded it into Power Query, worked with the Power Query UI, and performed tasks like removing rows, changing headers, modifying data types, and removing rows with "x" values. I also worked on removing columns, pivoting/unpivoting, and saving transformations.

**Day - 3**: I continued to analyze the data, loaded it into Power BI, explored auto-generated relationships, learned about cardinality, and cross-filter direction, made relationships active, and built relationships from scratch.

**Day - 4**: I worked on data analysis, created measures, and learned about DAX functions such as COUNT, SUM, SUMX, Date Functions, and If statements.

**Day - 5**: I focused on creating visualizations, including simple charts, adding multiple attributes on the same axis, and exploring drill-down, hierarchies, and the use of drill-down.

**Day - 6**: I continued creating visualizations, specifically working on conditional formatting and its various types and uses.

**Day - 7**: I explored new group bins and lists for visualizations and performed various operations using them.

**Day - 8**:  I created different types of visualizations such as Stacked Bar Charts, Stacked Column charts, Line charts, Line and Clustered Column charts, Scatter charts, Pie Charts/Donut Charts, Cards, and Tables.

**Day - 9**:  I utilized the knowledge I gained throughout the process and completed the **Data Professional Survey Breakdown** Dashboard, incorporating all the operations and visualizations.

**Day - 10**: Additionally I have done a new Simple **Sales Dashboard** by adding the Slicer operation.
